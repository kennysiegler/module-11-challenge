# module-11-challenge
##Description
This is my submission for the Module 11 Challenge

##Usage
I actually was never able to get chromedriver to run through Jupyter notebook. It ran in class through vs code but I couldn't get it to run through vs code today. Instead of opening a virtual browser to get the html I used the Python requests library and parsed the response to aa beautiful soup object through that.
